I craft characters and atmospheres that are fantastical, horrific, or downright psychedelic.Inspired by comics and diverse artistic movements, I blend hand-drawn sketches with digital touches to breathe life into emotions, stories, or simply… what disturbs and fascinates. Today, I create out of passion — tomorrow, perhaps for your project or my own graphic novel. Curious? Scan the QR code (or click!) to dive into my Instagram world!"
